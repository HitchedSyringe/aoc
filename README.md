## Using `new_day.py`

I'm mainly leaving this here for those who wish to use this file.

First, you need to grab your session token and store it in a `.session` file before running `python new_day.py --number <day_number>`. This creates a folder named as the day number containing three files: `first.py`, `second.py`, and `inputs.txt`. The Python files are pre-filled with the necessary boilerplate to read the contents of `inputs.txt`.
